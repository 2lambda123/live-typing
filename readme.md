# Chatting Interfaces
- Asynchronous: No indicator when the other person types
- Is typing: Common form of indicator (shows when the person is typing)
- Live typing: Shows the character a person is typing as they go
- Character (#) Typing: Masks the characters as # as the other person types

# To run the code:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone`
2. Install the npm packages using `npm install package.json`
3. Update the `case_indicator` variable in `script.js` (chat: no indicator, chat1: is typing, chat2: live typing, chat3: # typing)
4. Run the file using `node server.js`
